# NixOS Config
This is my personal NixOS config. It's currently based on [@Misterio77's starter template](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs), with plans to expand it to support multiple hosts (and, possibly, multiple users) in the future.

As this is my personal config, and it's still somewhat of a work-in-progress, it is **VERY** subject to change as I build it up to suit my needs (and wants).
